Subject: MSNbot issues?

Hello MSN WebMaster,

Unlike others (CPAN, OpenWatcom, etc.) I do not complain: 
my server happily copes with extra loads (and timeouts) 
so your robots are not a threat to our operations.

However, I have 4 very simple questions for you:

1) why your robots are trying to repeatedly fetch files
   that just can't exist (such as  <u>GET /'</u> )?

2) why, despite several robots working concurrently
   every day of the week, links and pages that have
   been removed from the Web site for months are still
   queried, pointlessly inflating 404 error traffic?

3) why a large ZIP or PDF file is fetched by the same
   robot many times at one or two seconds of interval
   for days?

4) why robots need to open TCP connections and do
   nothing for increasing delays (accept timeouts),
   or start sending a request but never finish it (read
   timeouts), or start fetching the server reply but
   never complete it (send timeouts), or do it in a so
   slow manner that it is ridiculous (slow timeouts)?

Failure to explain the legitimate needs for behaviors
such as those describbed above will inevitably push
Web site owners to forge their own opinions on the
matter -and this might not benefit to your company.

An official position from your organization is more
than welcome to dismiss any misplaced doubt.

Best regards,

Pierre.

Dear Pierre,

Thank you very much for contacting us.  I will try to 
get the information you requested as soon as possible.

The questions you have span different teams within Bing, 
so I am going to be collecting the answers and getting 
back to you. 

While we are investigating, I will appreciate if you 
can help us with information from your server logs.

If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Sultan

Hello Sultan,

Our domain names (trustleap.* and gwan.*)
are all mapped to one single IP address:
87.106.145.65

The involved robots are using the following
MICROSOFT networks:

[points #1-4]:
65.52.0.0 - 65.55.255.255

[point #2 only]:
207.46.0.0 - 207.46.255.255

You will find many of the 4 points described
previously in your activity logs.

Best regards,

Pierre.

Hello Sultan,

I forgot this network:

Hello Sultan,

&gt; The first two issues are already identified by us 
&gt; and we will be fixing them soon. 

Should I assume that these were considered as
"bugs" by MICROSOFT?

If so, can we now assume that as they were fixed,
these odd behaviors will no longer happen?

&gt; Regard to the issue (3), can you let us know what 
&gt; is the size of these zip files. 

ZIP: ~400 KB
PDF: 100KB-3.1MB

&gt; Can you provide us an IP address of the robot 
&gt; that is causing the issue (4)?

The list below may have duplicates, given its size, 
I did not bother to sort it by IP address (it is sorted
by date/time):

65.55.165.52 65.55.165.85 65.55.230.219 65.55.211.137

&gt; We do really appreciate your information.

I would really appreciate answers to my questions.

Best regards,

Pierre.

<p align="justify">Seven months later, MICROSOFT still did not explain why it uses its robots to disrupt the Web sites of its competitiors with the kind of <a class="linkbu extern" href="http://www.pam2010.ethz.ch/papers/full-length/22.pdf">time-out attacks that kill Apache and IIS</a> (yes, IIS too, thanks to a 120-second 'after accept' time-out).</p>
<p align="justify">While GOOGLE robots never attacked http://gwan.ch, MICROSOFT robots never stopped their attacks -even after my emails.</p>
<p align="justify">Would the practice be done by TrustLeap at the expense of the World Leader of Software, I would be in jail overnight.</p>

<br />
<p><b class="txtc">Cyveillance</b>, based in Washington D.C., started to attack gwan.com in July 2009, <i>3 days only after G-WAN v1.0 was publicly released</i>.<br />
<br />
And <b class="txtc">Cyveillance</b> sent <i>hand-crafted</i> attacks using the 3-day old G-WAN API (not just out-of-the-shelves junk requests):</p>

<p>And the very same unsuccessful attacks come on a regulary basis. Why? They are used as a cover channel to send (really dangerous) timeout attacks -the same deadly attacks that <b class="txtc">MICROSOFT Bing and MSN robots</b> are using under the cover of similar 'benign' junk traffic to crash Apache Web servers.</p>
<p>Its <a class="linkbu extern" href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/safety/industry/providers.mspx">mission statement</a> (proudly published by microsoft.com) tells it all:</p>

<div class="bule" style="width:34em;">
<div class="buletxt">
<p>"Cyveillance proactively eliminates threats enabling its customers to preserve their reputation and revenues".</p>
</div><em></em><tt></tt></div>
<p> </p>

<p>No wonder why <b class="txtc">Cyveillance</b> says <b class="txtc">MICROSOFT</b> is its largest customer:</p>
<p>With $6 billion invested in R&amp;D each year, <b class="txtc">MICROSOFT</b> is in serious need for 'protection' if it has to break international laws to attack challengers like <b class="txtc">G-WAN</b>, a <i>free</i> product developed in one single year by a single person -without any budget.</p>
